## Question (KPIs)
- The Blinkit Power BI project focuses on analyzing the following key KPIs to derive actionable business insights:

1. **Total Orders** – The overall number of orders placed.  
2. **Total Revenue** – The total income generated from orders.  
3. **Average Order Value (AOV)** – Revenue per order on average.  
4. **Order Fulfillment Rate** – Percentage of successfully delivered orders.  
5. **Delivery Time Analysis** – Average time taken to complete deliveries.  
6. **Customer Retention Rate** – Percentage of repeat customers.  
7. **Top-Selling Products** – Most frequently ordered items.  
8. **Peak Order Hours** – Time periods with the highest order volume.

## Project Process  

### 1. **Data Collection**  
- Gather raw data from Blinkit's business operations (orders, deliveries, customers, etc.).  
- Data sources include databases, Excel files, and APIs.  

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.  
- Perform data normalization and formatting.  
- Transform data using Power Query to prepare for analysis.  

### 3. **Data Modeling**  
- Create relationships between tables (orders, customers, products, etc.).  
- Implement calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).  
- Optimize data models for performance.  

### 4. **KPI Definition & Calculation**  
- Define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total orders, revenue, and customer retention.  
- Develop calculated fields and measures to track KPIs accurately.  

### 5. **Dashboard Design & Visualization**  
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards with charts, tables, and slicers.  
- Ensure intuitive design for stakeholders to explore insights easily.  
- Use best practices for visual hierarchy and storytelling.  

### 6. **Analysis & Insights**  
- Identify trends and patterns in customer behavior and operational efficiency.  
- Provide actionable recommendations based on findings.  

### 7. **Report Deployment & Sharing**  
- Publish reports to Power BI Service for access across devices.  
- Configure data refresh schedules for up-to-date insights.  
- Share reports with stakeholders via access controls and permissions.  

### 8. **Monitoring & Optimization**  
- Continuously monitor report performance and data accuracy.  
- Optimize dashboard performance based on user feedback and data volume changes.  
- Implement new features and updates as needed.
